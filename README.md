MemComparer
===========


*The most recent executable in master is also checked in for convenience: https://github.com/Seikilos/MemComparer/raw/master/MemoryComparer/bin/Release/LISMemoryComparer.exe*

Fork from base implementation at http://thinkexception.blogspot.de/2010/06/tool-to-bompare-two-windbg-dumpheap.html providing bug fixes. The original edition does not handle dumps with x64 address spaces well, so I decided to fix it.

This is a small app for all of us, which do not have access to VS2012/2013 Ultimate Edition, which is capable of comparing two different dmp files against .net memory allocations.
